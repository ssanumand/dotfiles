# Neovim Configuration (_zero plugins_)

This is my Neovim configuration. I'm a minimalist, and hence I've written all the configurations _from scratch without any plugins._

## Features

1. Full LSP Support for:
   1. Python (with Ruff and Pyright)
   2. Go
   3. Support for Formatting HTML/CSS/JS/Markdown with Prettier
2. Easy Keyboard Bindings
3. Netrw and FZF Support

*Note: Resize key-mappings (`<C-H>`, `<C-L>`, etc.) are currently commented out due to conflict with window focus controls.*

This configuration offers a productive foundation for daily usage and development across languages.

## Important

There are some weird things that I want you to remember when working with this configuration:
1. The `PythonPyrightSetInterpreterPath {path}` works only when you have at least one buffer opened and attached to the LSP. Please do not invoke it without this as it'll not work.
